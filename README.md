# hello-world
This repository is to get an understanding/practice with Github.
My name is Phillip Ward, and I am in the Masters of Science in Data Science at Boston University.
I love playing video games, coding, and spending time with my family.
I am excited about this journey and plan on starting a career as a data scientist.
